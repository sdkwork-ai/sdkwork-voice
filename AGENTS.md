# Repository Guidelines

<!-- SDKWORK-AGENTS-GENERATED: v1 -->

## SDKWORK Soul

Read `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` before executing tasks in this root. Follow specs before memory, dictionary before context, stop on ambiguity, and evidence before completion.

## SDKWORK Standards

Canonical SDKWORK specs path from this root:

- `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`

Do not copy root standard text into this repository. If these relative paths do not resolve, stop and report the broken workspace layout.

## Application Identity

`sdkwork.app.config.json` is present at this root. Application behavior, runtime config, SDK wiring, and deployment metadata are declared there and in `deployments/deploy.yaml`.

## Local Dictionary Structure

- `AGENTS.md`: local agent entrypoint and relative SDKWORK spec index.
- `CLAUDE.md`: Claude Code compatibility shim that points to `AGENTS.md` and must not duplicate rules.
- `GEMINI.md`: Gemini CLI compatibility shim that points to `AGENTS.md` and must not duplicate rules.
- `CODEX.md`: Codex compatibility shim that points to `AGENTS.md` and must not duplicate rules.
- `sdkwork.app.config.json`: application root manifest (also under `apps/sdkwork-voice-pc/` for PC embed).
- `.sdkwork/`: reserved local dictionary folder; create only for local skills, plugins, manifests, or AI workspace metadata.
- `specs/`: not present here; use when local contracts need to narrow root standards.
- `sdks/`: SDK families, OpenAPI authorities, route manifests, and generated SDK artifacts.
- `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: language/build manifests.
- Local directories to inspect first when relevant: `apps/`, `crates/`, `scripts/`, `sdks/`, `tests/`.

## Documentation Canon

- [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)
- [docs/product/prd/PRD.md](docs/product/prd/PRD.md)
- [docs/architecture/tech/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/architecture/tech/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Spec Resolution Order

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` and any nearer component-level `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` when present.
3. Read local `specs/README.md` and `specs/component.spec.json` when present.
4. Read local `.sdkwork/README.md`, `.sdkwork/skills/`, and `.sdkwork/plugins/` when relevant.
5. Read `../sdkwork-specs/README.md` and the task-specific root specs.
6. Inspect implementation files only after the relevant dictionary entries are clear.

## Required Specs By Task Type

- Agent/workflow changes: `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`.
- Any code change: `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`, plus only the touched language/framework spec.
- Rust code: `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_RPC_SPEC.md` when RPC is touched.
- Java/Spring code: `../sdkwork-specs/JAVA_CODE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_BACKEND_SPEC.md` when HTTP backend behavior is touched.
- TypeScript/Node code: `../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`.
- Frontend/UI code: `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/UI_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, and exactly one detailed UI architecture spec.
- API, SDK, database, runtime, security, and deployment changes must follow the task matrix in `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`.

Language-specific specs are on-demand; do not load Rust, Java, TypeScript, and frontend specs for unrelated tasks.

## Int64 Wire Contract (API_SPEC §13.6)

- OpenAPI `int64` fields and parameters `MUST` be `type: string`, `format: int64`,
  a decimal `pattern` such as `^-?[0-9]+$`, and `x-sdkwork-int64-string: true`.
  `type: integer, format: int64` is a contract violation: generated TypeScript
  SDKs then emit `number`, and browsers silently round ids past
  `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53), replaying wrong ids into lookups.
- Rust response DTOs `MUST` serialize `i64` wire fields with
  `#[serde(with = "sdkwork_utils_rust::serde_int64")]` (or `::option`); request
  boundaries parse inbound strings with the same helper.
- Generated TypeScript SDKs keep `int64` as `string`; frontend code `MUST NOT`
  convert ids/snowflake ids/sequence ids to `number` for storage, comparison,
  or submission.
- Verification: `node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-api-operation-patterns.mjs --workspace .`

## Code Style Rules

Read `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` before code changes.

Load language specs only when touched: Rust uses `RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`, Java/Spring uses `JAVA_CODE_SPEC.md`, TypeScript/Node uses `TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`, and frontend/UI uses `FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md`.

For TypeScript or frontend code, prefer strict types, explicit package exports, colocated tests, and existing package/module boundaries.

Build scripts, dev runners, and `pnpm clean` must follow `CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` §7 (Build Source Integrity And Self-Healing). Git-tracked build-critical source files must be verified before builds and self-healed from git when missing; `clean` must not delete them.

## Build, Test, and Verification

Run commands from this directory unless a command explicitly targets another path.

- `pnpm install`: install dependencies for this workspace or package.
- `pnpm run test`: run the configured test suite for this scope.
- `pnpm run typecheck`: run TypeScript type checks.
- `pnpm run test:rust`: run the configured test suite for this scope.

Run the narrowest relevant check first, then broader verification when API contracts, SDK generation, persistence, security, or cross-package boundaries change.

## Agent Execution Rules

Use the convention dictionary instead of broad context loading. Do not hand-edit generated SDK output unless the task is explicitly about generated artifacts and the source contract is verified. Do not replace generated SDK integration with raw HTTP. Keep changes scoped to the owning module, package, crate, or app root. Record the exact verification commands and important outputs before reporting completion.

## App SDK Consumer Imports



Application, feature, shell, and service packages `MUST` consume HTTP SDKs through scoped composed consumer packages, not generator transport package names.



- App API clients: `@sdkwork/<application-code>-app-sdk`

- Backend API clients (`backend-admin` only): `@sdkwork/<application-code>-backend-sdk`

- Federated Cloud Router domain surfaces: `@sdkwork/cloudrouter-app-sdk/domains` and `@sdkwork/cloudrouter-backend-sdk/domains`

- Open/domain API clients: `@sdkwork/<domain>-sdk`



Canonical examples (IAM):



```typescript

import { createClient, type SdkworkAppClient } from '@sdkwork/iam-app-sdk';

import type { SdkworkBackendClient } from '@sdkwork/iam-backend-sdk'; // backend-admin only

import { createClient as createCloudRouterDomainsClient } from '@sdkwork/cloudrouter-app-sdk/domains';

```



Forbidden in application `apps/`, `packages/`, bootstrap, services, UI, contract tests, and composed SDK `src/**` outside generator ownership:



- `sdkwork-*-app-sdk-generated-typescript`, `sdkwork-*-backend-sdk-generated-typescript`, and other generator transport names as consumer imports

- `@sdkwork/commerce-app-sdk`, `@sdkwork/commerce-backend-sdk`, `@sdkwork/cloudrouter-*-domain-transport-sdk`

- filesystem paths containing `domain-transport-typescript`, `domain-transport-sdk`, or sibling `*-typescript/generated` hops from composed `src/**`

- deep imports into `generated/server-openapi/src/*` from consumers when a composed facade exists



Allowed:



- Composed facade entry imports such as `@sdkwork/iam-app-sdk`, `@sdkwork/knowledgebase-app-sdk`, and `@sdkwork/cloudrouter-app-sdk/domains`

- Composed re-exports that import only from `../generated/**` within the same `*-sdk-typescript` family root

- Generated transport ownership inside `sdks/**/generated/**` only



Each SDK family `MUST` expose the composed TypeScript facade at `sdks/<sdk-family>/<sdk-family>-typescript/src/index.ts` (and optional subpath exports such as `./domains`) with `package.json#name` equal to the scoped consumer package.



Before completing SDK integration or frontend service work, run:



```bash

node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-app-sdk-consumer-imports.mjs --workspace <workspace-root>

```

## HTTP API Response Envelope

All L2+ SDKWork-owned custom HTTP contracts, including `app-api`, `backend-api`, and SDKWork-owned business `open-api`, `MUST` follow `API_SPEC.md` section 4.5, section 14, and section 15:

- **Default classification:** omitted `x-sdkwork-wire-protocol` means SDKWork-owned custom API (`sdkwork-v3`); only operation-level `x-sdkwork-wire-protocol: external` plus `x-sdkwork-external-protocol-id` identifies a third-party compatibility `open-api` operation.
- **Input:** typed request bodies, section 14.1 list/search/command input, `SdkWorkListQuery`, and `q` for free-text search.
- **Success output:** `SdkWorkApiResponse` with `{ "code": 0, "data": <payload>, "traceId": "<server-uuid>" }`.
- **Error output:** HTTP 4xx/5xx `application/problem+json` (`ProblemDetail`) with numeric `code` and `traceId`.
- Success `code` is numeric `int32`; HTTP 2xx JSON bodies `MUST` use `0` only. REST semantics remain on HTTP status (`201`, `202`, etc.).
- Platform error codes are numeric non-zero values per section 15.3 (`40001`, `40101`, `40401`, …).
- Single resource: `data.item`
- Lists: `data.items` + `data.pageInfo` (`PageInfo.mode` is `offset` or `cursor`)
- Commands: `data.accepted` plus optional `resourceId` / `status`
- Async accept (`202`): `data.operationId`, `data.status`, optional `pollUrl`
- Operation patterns: retrieve/list/search/create/update/delete/command/async/bulk semantics follow `API_SPEC.md` section 15.4; create uses `201`, delete uses `204` with no JSON body, and `PUT`/`PATCH` use SDK action `update`.

Vendor compatibility `open-api` routes that mirror upstream tool or provider wire (for example OpenAI `/v1/*`, Anthropic/Claude `/anthropic/v1/*`, Google/Gemini `/google/v1beta/*`, Claude Code, or Codex) `MAY` opt out only when every exempt operation declares operation-level `x-sdkwork-wire-protocol: external` and `x-sdkwork-external-protocol-id` per `API_SPEC.md` section 4.5.2. SDKWork-owned business `open-api` operations `MUST NOT` opt out. Mixed OpenAPI documents are validated per operation; one external operation never exempts SDKWork-owned operations in the same document.

Errors `MUST` use HTTP 4xx/5xx with `application/problem+json` (`ProblemDetail`) including required numeric `code` and `traceId`. Business failures `MUST NOT` use HTTP 2xx with non-zero `code`, string wire codes, `success`, or human `message`.

Forbidden legacy envelopes and fields: `PlusApiResult`, `AppbaseApiResult`, `StoreApiResult`, `SdkWorkResponse`, per-domain `*ApiResult`, wire field `requestId`, bare domain DTOs at the HTTP root, and top-level `{ items, pageInfo, traceId }` without `data`.

Handlers `MUST` serialize success and map errors through `sdkwork-web-framework` response mapping. Generated HTTP SDKs (`--standard-profile sdkwork-v3`) unwrap `data` by default and expose typed numeric `ProblemDetail.code` / `traceId` on errors; use `.raw` when the full envelope is required.

Before completing API contract, SDK generation, or frontend service work, run:

```bash
node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-api-operation-patterns.mjs --workspace <workspace-root>
node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-api-response-envelope.mjs --workspace <workspace-root>
```

Authority: `sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md` section 4.5 and sections 14–16, `SDK_SPEC.md` section 4.2, `FRONTEND_SPEC.md`, `MIGRATION_SPEC.md` section 4.2.

## List And Search Pagination

All L2+ list/search APIs and their backing services, repositories, SDK consumers, and interactive frontend lists `MUST` follow `PAGINATION_SPEC.md`:

- **Input:** standard `SdkWorkListQuery` or query params (`page`/`page_size` or `cursor`/`page_size` per `API_SPEC.md` §14.1); default `page_size` `20`; max `200` unless a documented exception exists.
- **Output:** `SdkWorkApiResponse.data.items` + `data.pageInfo` with `PageInfo.mode` (`offset` or `cursor`) per `API_SPEC.md` §16.
- **Store-level pagination:** push filtering, sorting, and page selection to SQL `LIMIT`/keyset or incrementally maintained indexes — never unbounded collect then `skip`/`take`/`slice` in process memory (`PAGINATION_SPEC.md` §2).
- **SDK and frontend:** interactive lists request one page at a time from the server; no default `listAll*` on P0/P1 paths; no client-side `slice` pagination over full downloads.

Before completing list/search API, repository, SDK list helper, projection read model, or paginated UI work, run:

```bash
node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-pagination.mjs --workspace <workspace-root>
```

Authority: `PAGINATION_SPEC.md`, `API_SPEC.md` §14.1/§16, `DATABASE_SPEC.md` §20.5, `WEB_BACKEND_SPEC.md` §12, `SDK_SPEC.md` §4.2/§6, `FRONTEND_SPEC.md`, `APP_SDK_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md` §9.

## Human Review Rules

Request human review before breaking SDKWORK standards, changing public naming, altering security/auth behavior, changing database migrations or production deployment config, deleting data/files, or changing generated SDK ownership. Surface unresolved spec paths, app identity conflicts, component ownership conflicts, and API authority ambiguity instead of guessing.

<!-- SDKWORK-NAMING-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Rust Naming And Dependency Declaration

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` section 3.1 and section 3.2.

Two identifier planes exist in every Rust crate and they MUST NOT be mixed: the package plane
(Cargo, filesystem, lock file) uses kebab-case, and the crate plane (lib target, modules, source
imports) uses snake_case.

- `[package].name`, the crate directory, `[features]` keys, and `[[bin]].name` use kebab-case.
- `[lib].name`, module files, module directories, and Rust imports use snake_case.
- A crate whose `[package].name` contains a hyphen SHOULD declare `[lib].name` explicitly
  (default: package name with every `-` replaced by `_`). A shorter lib name is allowed only
  when declared explicitly and used consistently by every consumer.
- Cargo dependency keys, `[workspace.dependencies]` keys, and `Cargo.lock` entries use the
  dependency package name. Use `package = "..."` when an alias is required.
- Every external crate referenced by `src/` MUST be declared in that crate's `[dependencies]`.
  Test-only crates belong in `[dev-dependencies]`; `build.rs` crates belong in
  `[build-dependencies]`.
- Never delete a dependency line, and never demote one from `[dependencies]` to
  `[dev-dependencies]`, while `src/` still imports it. Verify manifest cleanups with the
  command below before committing them.
- Regenerate and commit `Cargo.lock` in the same change as any dependency table edit.

Verification:

```bash
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-rust-crate-naming-standard.mjs --root .

<!-- /SDKWORK-NAMING-STANDARD: v1 -->

<!-- SDKWORK-RUST-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Rust Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2, industry-best baseline); package/crate
naming and dependency declaration are normative in `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` section 3.1
and 3.2.

- Crates are responsibility-shaped: service, repository-sqlx, routes, service-host, native-host,
  worker, assembly, gateway. No generic `core`/`common`/`backend`/`runtime` suffixes.
- Errors are typed enums (`thiserror`) implementing `std::error::Error` with a `source` chain.
  `anyhow` only at binary/CLI/test boundaries, never in lib `[dependencies]`.
- No `unsafe` without a `// SAFETY:` comment; crates default to `unsafe_code = "forbid"`.
  No `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!`/`todo!`/`dbg!` in library code reachable from public API.
- No lock guard held across `.await`; every external await has a timeout; spawned tasks are
  awaited/detached with a documented owner; retries are bounded, jittered, and idempotent.
- Public API is minimal, documented, `#[must_use]` where applicable, and semver-clean. Leaking
  framework types (`sqlx::Row`, axum extractors) through public signatures is forbidden.
- Workspace root declares `[workspace.package]` (edition, rust-version) and `[workspace.lints]`
  (RUST_CODE_SPEC.md section 13 baseline); every member inherits both with
  `edition.workspace = true` and `[lints] workspace = true`.

<!-- SDKWORK-TYPESCRIPT-CODE-STANDARD: v1 -->
## TypeScript Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2, industry-best baseline).

- `tsconfig` runs `strict: true` and the strict family; public APIs are typed and `any`-free.
  `import type` is required for type-only imports (`verbatimModuleSyntax`).
- Errors are typed at package/service boundaries; no empty catches, no swallowed promise
  rejections, no bare `throw new Error('...')` for business failures.
- Async: every promise is settled; external awaits have timeouts; `AbortSignal` accepted for
  cancellable work; bounded concurrency; no unbounded `Promise.all`.
- Public API is minimal, JSDoc-documented, `@deprecated` where applicable, and semver-clean.
- Discriminated unions model closed variant sets; no `as`/`@ts-ignore` bypasses without a guard.
- Node/build runners verify build-critical sources and self-heal from git (CODE_STYLE_SPEC §7);
  `pnpm clean` never deletes git-tracked build-critical files.

## Frontend Code Standard

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md` (v2); language rules follow
`../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md` (React/TS) or `../sdkwork-specs/DART_CODE_SPEC.md` (Flutter).

- UI -> service -> injected SDK flow is preserved; components never construct SDK clients or
  assemble raw HTTP/auth headers.
- React: hooks rules clean (`react-hooks`), `useEffect` with full deps and cleanup, stable
  list keys, error boundaries at route/page level, derived state during render (not in effects).
- State: server state behind services/query layer; client state local or minimal typed store;
  no duplication of server state in client stores.
- Accessibility: accessible names, keyboard behavior, visible focus, color is never the only
  signal; error states announced.
- i18n for all user-facing copy in reusable/user-facing packages (I18N_SPEC §6.1).
- PC/H5 `outDir` uses `dist/{standalone,cloud}/{dev,test,staging,prod}`.

## pnpm Workspace Dependency And Package Import

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_WORKSPACE_DEPENDENCY_SPEC.md` (companion to
`../sdkwork-specs/DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT_SPEC.md`).

Sibling SDKWork repositories are consumed through a dual-track model that MUST stay consistent:

- **Local development** (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`): pnpm workspace protocol. Each sibling
  package is declared ONCE in this repository root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `packages:` as a
  `../sdkwork-*` relative path, and consumed with `workspace:*` in `package.json`. Never use
  `file:`/`link:`/git-URL specifiers for SDKWork sibling packages in any environment.
- **CI / release packaging**: git-repository dependency checkout. Every sibling referenced by the
  local workspace MUST have a matching `dependencies[]` entry in `sdkwork.workflow.json` so CI
  clones the sibling into the same `../sdkwork-*` relative layout (`GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`).
  `package.json` is never rewritten for CI.

Import rules for sibling SDKWork packages:

- Import by package name only: `import { X } from "@sdkwork/package-name"`. The specifier MUST
  equal the target package's `package.json` `name` exactly - no shortening, renaming, or alias.
- Forbidden: relative imports that cross a package boundary into another SDKWork repository or
  another workspace package's `src/` (for example `import ... from "../../sdkwork-appbase/.../src/..."`).
- Consume only the public `exports` surface of a package; never deep-import sibling `src/` internals.
- Every non-relative import in a workspace member MUST resolve to that member's own
  `dependencies`/`devDependencies`/`peerDependencies` (import closure).
- Vite aliases MUST NOT rename or redirect `@sdkwork/*` packages, MUST NOT be added to make a
  resolution error pass, and are allowed only for documented bootstrap/SDK-generation entrypoints.
- Fix a resolution failure by correcting the workspace declaration or the package `exports`,
  not by adding an alias.

## Generated SDK Output Is Generator-Owned

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_SPEC.md`.

Everything generated under `sdks/` — `generated/server-openapi/` trees, generated language
workspaces, `dist/` build output, generated `sdkwork-sdk.json`, generated
`.sdkwork/sdkwork-generator-*` reports, and standardizer-synced OpenAPI snapshots — is produced by
the canonical SDK generator `../sdkwork-sdk-generator/bin/sdkgen.js` (`@sdkwork/sdk-generator`).

- Do not hand-edit generated SDK files, including type definitions, dist bundles, and generated
  package metadata. Manual edits are overwritten by the next generation run and break
  reproducibility and contract audits.
- When generated or compiled SDK output does not meet a contract or standard, fix the upstream
  source — authored API contract, route manifest, OpenAPI authority, derived `*.sdkgen.*` input,
  generator profile, or `custom/` runtime build scripts — then regenerate through the standard
  generation command. Do not patch generated output in place.
- Remove stale generated files by re-running the family generation command, which owns cleanup of
  disappeared routes and models; do not hand-prune generated trees.
- The only approved handwritten surfaces are `custom/` roots inside generated workspaces and
  authored `composed/` facades outside `generated/server-openapi`.

## Deployment Standard (bin/)

Per `../sdkwork-specs/MODULE_BIN_SPEC.md`, this module ships the standardized
nine-entrypoint `bin/` family; all build/package/deploy/installer work `MUST`
go through them. See `bin/README.md` for the usage card and
`bin/lib/module.sh` for the delegation wiring (hooks not yet wired to a
canonical repository command fail fast with guidance).

- App types declared: see `SDKWORK_APP_TYPES` in `bin/lib/module.sh`;
  environments: `development`, `test`, `staging`, `demo`, `production`.
- Image reference: `registry.sdkwork.com/apps/<docker-name>:<version>`
  (`DOCKER_SPEC.md` §2.1; no `latest`, no env-suffixed tags).
- Authoritative specs: `MODULE_BIN_SPEC.md`, `DOCKER_SPEC.md`,

<!-- SDKWORK-DESTRUCTIVE-OPERATION-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Destructive Operation Safety

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATION_SPEC.md`.

Deletion must be explicit, enumerated, and reviewable. Deleting by pattern instead of by named
path is forbidden. Wildcards are for read-only commands only.

- `git rm -r`, `git rm` over a directory or pattern, and `git clean -f`/`-fd`/`-fdx` are
  FORBIDDEN. A recursive `git rm` stages many deletions in one index transaction; if the process
  is interrupted (SIGTERM, timeout, sandbox kill, crash) entries are already gone from disk while
  the index is only half-written, which is silent non-atomic mass data loss.
- Delete tracked files with `rm <exact/path>` on each named path, let `git status --short`
  record the `D` entries, then stage only the enumerated paths. Commit the deletion separately
  from functional changes.
- Shell and script deletion by wildcard is FORBIDDEN: `rm -rf`/`rm -r`/`rm -f` with
  `*`/`**`/`?`/`[...]`/brace expansion, `find ... -delete`, `find ... -exec rm`,
  `find ... | xargs rm`, `for f in *; do rm ...`, `del /S /Q`, `rd /S /Q`,
  `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` on a glob, `shutil.rmtree`, `fs.rm(dir, { recursive: true })`,
  and `rimraf` over a glob.
- A deletion MUST NOT be combined in one shell invocation with a build, install, network, or
  publish step, and MUST NOT derive its targets from an unvalidated argument, environment
  variable, or configuration value.
- Permitted narrow deletion: `rm <exact/path>`; a short literal path list owned by the tool that
  declares it; the module's own generated artifacts through its owning tool
  (`pnpm clean`, `cargo clean`) per `CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` §7; and
  `git restore --worktree --source=HEAD -- <exact paths>`.
- Required sequence before any deletion: enumerate exact paths; confirm every path resolves inside
  the active repository or module root; classify tracked/generated/cached/unknown; prefer `rm`
  plus tracked `git status`; delete in batches of 20 or fewer with a status check between
  batches; report the removed paths and the authorizing decision.
- Request explicit human confirmation before deleting any git-tracked path, any directory tree,
  any path resolving outside the active repository root, or more than 20 paths.
- Recovery after an accidental mass deletion: clear a stale `.git/index.lock`, write the path
  list to a file INSIDE the repository (never `/tmp` on Windows, where the Git Bash path space
  and the native tool path space disagree), and run a single
  `git restore --worktree --pathspec-from-file=<repo-relative-list>`. Never loop one
  version-control call per path; the same termination cause interrupts the loop part-way.

<!-- SDKWORK-ROLLBACK-RESTRICTION-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Rollback Restriction And Fix-Forward Discipline

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/ROLLBACK_RESTRICTION_SPEC.md`.

Errors are fixed forward. Version-control history is never rewound to make an error disappear.

- A rollback is any operation that moves a ref, resets the index or the working tree to an earlier
  state, discards uncommitted or committed work, or rewrites published history. It is FORBIDDEN as
  the remedy for a defect — a build failure, a type error, a lint failure, a failing test, a merge
  conflict, a runtime regression, a bad refactor, or an unclear diff. Repair forward instead, by
  adding, editing, or restoring content through a new commit.
- FORBIDDEN by an agent or a human-issued command: `git reset --hard` in any form;
  `git reset --merge`/`--keep`; `git reset <ref>` that discards staged or working-tree content;
  `git checkout -f`, `git switch -f`, `git restore --source=<ref> --worktree .`;
  `git revert` as a reflex error remedy; `git stash drop`/`clear` and `git stash pop` over a
  conflict; `git branch -D` on a branch with unmerged work; `git update-ref -d` and direct
  `.git/refs/` edits; `git reflog expire`, `git gc --prune=now`, `git prune`;
  `git commit --amend` over a pushed commit; `git rebase`, `git rebase -i`, `git rebase --onto`;
  `git filter-branch`; `git push --force`, `git push --force-with-lease`, and
  `git push --delete`.
- A rollback is never inferred from context or tone. "Fix it", "it's broken", "this is a mess",
  "start over", "just revert it", and "退回" are not rollback instructions. If the intent is
  ambiguous, STOP and ask — including whether the instruction means to discard work or to restore
  lost work, because that distinction decides the permissible operation.
- Discarding work requires a separate, explicit, human-issued instruction that names the operation,
  the target ref, the discarded span, and the reason, and that acknowledges the loss. The
  authorization must be quoted in the commit message. A standing authorization is not accepted.
- Recovery is ADDITIVE: `git restore --worktree --source=<ref> -- <exact paths>`, or
  `git checkout <good-ref> --pathspec-from-file=<repo-relative-list>` with the list written inside
  the repository. The pathspec must be an explicit enumerated list — never a directory, glob, brace
  expansion, or the repository root — and a restore is never combined with a build, install,
  publish, or commit step in the same shell invocation.
- Before a bulk restore: commit any local modification as a checkpoint; create a backup branch AND a
  tag AND a patch file and verify they point at the pre-restore state; produce a written
  three-snapshot blob comparison (damaged revision vs its parent vs the candidate older snapshot)
  that separates REPLACED files from files the damaged revision legitimately AUTHORED; restore the
  relative complement, not the whole tree; and keep the files the damaged revision added.
- Never treat a local tracking ref as evidence about a remote. Confirm with
  `git ls-remote <remote> <branch>` and record the returned object id.
- After a restore, verify by content hash rather than by reading files, re-run the gates that cover
  the restored surface, and classify each remaining failure as caused-by-the-restore or
  pre-existing. A pre-existing claim must be proven by showing the same failure at the prior
  revision with `git show <ref>:<path>`, not reasoned about. Fix forward. Never un-restore.
- Never bypass a hook, signature, or gate with `--force`, `--no-verify`, or `--no-gpg-sign` to
  land a repair.
